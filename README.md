# Soccer Timer

I know what you're thinking: this isn't an original idea. There are so many other apps that allow coaches to manager their youth soccer teams - allowing them to log the time on the field, elect subsitutions, etc.
You are 100% right.

But I didn't like those.

They required me to sign up with an account, had in-app purchases, only allowed me to subsitute Kid1 with Kid3 and didn't account for unpredictability of Kid3 getting a ball straigt to the face and needing Kid7 to take their place - Kid1 can't go back in because they've already had their share of time on the field.

So yeah. I prefered to see the time the kids were on the field. I liked the idea of seeing a running log. I liked the idea of the priority of each kid getting bumped up because their time logged was shorter than the others who had already been in. It is made in the way that I was organically managing my player's time on the field. Hoping it can work for others too!
